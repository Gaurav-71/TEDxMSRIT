            "Dr. Qian Wang, the author of over 20 research publications, many of which are based on the study of photocatalysts and their use in solar energy conversion, has been working as a researcher at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge, UK. She is currently working on the generation of renewable energy via artificial photosynthesis as an alternative to fossil fuels. Harvesting sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into chemical fuels has been a promising technology but has faced challenges like the assembly of efficient, selective and scalable systems without sacrificial reagents and external bias. The technology that Dr. Wang is working on, is referred to as ‘artificial leaf’ which can convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into hydrogen and other carbon-based fuels. The breakthrough has been cited by many news journals, including BBC news, The Times, News Atlas, Innovation origins and DesignNews. It is hoped that this technology will pave the way toward sustainable and practical solar fuel production. We are honored to have Dr. Qian Wang address the “Energy” problem statement and are excited to know more about her discoveries in the field.",

He worked in Hong Kong for 11 years before deciding to quit the rat race and start recreational scuba diving in Goa, India, in 1995. He founded Coastal Impact with the intention of building awareness about marine ecosystems and motivating people to become divers and ‘ocean ambassadors’ , as well as join in to save Goa’s precious marine life. Besides conducting underwater surveys for Central Marine Fisheries Research Institiute, Worldwide Fund for Nature, The National Institute of Oceanography (the very first UNDP funded survey of remote submerged reefs at Angria Banks) and a number of independent marine biologists and NGOs all over the West coast of India, Venkat has also done the sole surveys India for sharks for The Paul Allen Family Foundation (Bill Gates' partner in Microsoft) owned Global Finprint,which completed a worldwide survey for sharks and rays. This year, Coastal Impact will be completeling the Microfragmentation Coral Reef Transplantation Project and is looking to start a Environmental DNA project to do a comprehensive study of underwater biodiversity all over the west coast of India next year. We are honoured to have him address 'Nature' problem statement and excited to learn from his research and practices throughout his journey.",

            "Shailesh Awate, A Farmer & Teacher. A co-founder of OOO farms. Gave up his comfortable Business in Mumbai. Along with his friends wanting to do something about the growing deforestation taking place inside the Sahyadri hills of western India. Ever since he was a young boy, Awate trekked the hills of this biodiversity and had grown concerned about this issue after which he found out that the indigenous people who used to practice sustainable farming were now growing produce for urban markets due to the road construction which led them to cut down forests. Traditional farming methods were abandoned and Industrial Agricultural models-provided hybrid seeds, fertilizers and pesticides were used which damaged the ecosystem. Awate and his friends developed the passion to tackle this issue and encourage sustainable Agroforestry farming with environmental protection. After a long struggle and focus to save the forest, OOO farms was formed training farmers to follow sustainable Primitive methods of farming with indigenous seeds, Conserving & Propagating them through Seed Banks . He along with his Friends have designed few Successful Economical Models for Farmers He has also been instrumental in devicing and Teaching a Subject for School Students 'Graam- Village' to groom minds to move towardsTodays Village and reversing Village Drain, OOO Farm works with 800 Farmer Families in 42 Village Hamlets over a Span of 650 kms of Sahyadri Range growing 45 varieties of indigenous grains and more than 100 types of wild food. Awate believes that this endeavor will positively impact and help tribal communities realize that they are the custodians of the heritage to protect, conserve and increase forest produce.",
